# CFD-files
Here are some files that might come useful to get started with a CFD simulation.
Blasius velocity profile is based on analytical solution of a flow over a flat plate. He was able to get this using similarity solution.
Inflation layer calculator estimates the first layer height, total height, and number of layers. This is required to capture the boundary layer effect (viscous momentum transfer as a result of no-slip condition at the wall) and is based on the theory of law of the wall or log law proposed by the giant von-Karman. 
These files are based on flow over a flat plate.
